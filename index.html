      <h2 class='alt-text'>Tryout Tips</h2>
      <p>When trying out for cheer make sure you look the part. Try going online and see how the college you're trying out is styled. What type of makeup do they wear? How do they do their hair? etc. Next, make sure you talk to as many of the girls on the team as you can and show them who you are as a person. You want the team to like and remember you.</p>

        <p> I am 22 years old and I currently cheer for Western Colorado University. I transfered last year from an NAIA college, Westcliff University, where we took home 1st place at NCA 2 years in a row. I have been doing all-star cheer for most of life and cheerleading is where I thrive.</p>
